/**
 @mainpage A strict JSON parser and generator for Objective-C

 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
 format. This framework provides two apis for parsing and generating
 JSON. One standard object-based and a higher level api consisting of
 categories added to existing Objective-C classes.

 This framework does its best to be as strict as possible, both in what it
 accepts and what it generates. For example, it does not support trailing commas
 in arrays or objects. Nor does it support embedded comments, or
 anything else not in the JSON specification. This is considered a feature.
 
 Learn more on the http://code.google.com/p/json-framework project site.
  
 @page page_working_with_scalars Working with scalars
 
 Strictly speaking correctly formed JSON text must have <strong>exactly
 one top-level container</strong>. (Either an Array or an Object.) Scalars,
 i.e. nulls, numbers, booleans and strings, are not valid JSON on their own.
 It can be quite convenient to pretend that such fragments are valid
 JSON however, and this framework lets you do so.
 
 A scalar is also referred to as a "fragment".
